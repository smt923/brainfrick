# brainfrick
Brainf*ck interpreter written in Rust

This is by no means a 'perfect' implementation of Brainf*ck, just written for fun.

## Usage
Simply run the program with a path to some Brainf*ck code.

```bash
echo "This would be a fantastic way to store all my user's passwords" | brainfrick.exe rot13.b

"Guvf jbhyq or n snagnfgvp jnl gb fgber nyy zl hfre'f cnffjbeqf"
```

## Brainf*ck code examples note
None of the BF code found in programs\ is written by me, and, apart from `helloworld.b` is all copyright Daniel B Cristofani, and the original programs are all available on [his website](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/)
